      <h2>Why Edinburgh?</h2>
      <h3>Edinburgh, The Greenest city in the United Kingdom </h3>
      <p>
        Edinburgh, is known for being one of the most beautiful cities in the
         world, its historic attractions, UNESCO World Heritage sites, and
         rich history. Widely considered the world's best festival city,
         it's a powerhouse for the literary arts, comedy, culture, high education, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the best universities in the world. The University of Edinburgh is often ranked in the world's top 20 universities, and it's been a major powerhouse in education ever since it first opened in 1583.
        A number of history's greatest thinkers and scientists had their
        start at this prestigious university. It's often said that even Sir Arthur Conan Doyle found his inspiration for the iconic character Sherlock Holmes here.
        Today, many of the university's alumni have gone on to be Nobel Prize winners, prime ministers, and space explorers.

            <h2>Dean Village</h2>
            <p>
              Dean Village was previously where milling of water mills took place,
              of which remains of this can still be seen by visitors.
              Hidden in the village, you will come across a variety of mill stones
              and stone plaques decorated with baked bread and pies.
              The Dean Bridge can also be found if you walk along the walkway following
              the Water of Leith.
              The Bridge and St Bernard's Well were both designed by Thomas Telford.
           </p>
            <p>
              At the heart of the village is Well Court, the most iconic building in the village. This building was built in the 1880s
              and housed local workers who worked at the water mills.
              Just a short walk away, visitors can also browse exhibitions
              in the Dean Gallery and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art.
              Both buildings were previously converted and refurbished to be used
              as art galleries and many of their exhibitions are free.
