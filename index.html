      <h2>Why Edinburgh?</h2>
      <h3>Edinburgh, The Greenest city in the United Kingdom </h3>
      <p>
        Edinburgh, is known for being one of the most beautiful cities in the world, its historic attractions, UNESCO World Heritage sites, and rich history.
        Widely considered the world's best festival city, it's a powerhouse for the literary arts, comedy, culture, high education, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the best universities in the world. The University of Edinburgh is often ranked in the world's top 20 universities, and it's been a major powerhouse in education ever since it first opened in 1583.
        A number of history's greatest thinkers and scientists had their start at this prestigious university. It's often said that even Sir Arthur Conan Doyle found his inspiration for the iconic character Sherlock Holmes here.
        Today, many of the university's alumni have gone on to be Nobel Prize winners, prime ministers, and space explorers.

            <h4>Arthur's Seat</h4>
            <p>A Realitivly short but strenuous walk.</h5>
            <p>One of several peaks in the long-extinct volcanic ridge that towers behind Edinburgh, Arthur's Seat offers hill walking in the heart of the city.
            Set within the 640-acre (260-hectare) Holyrood Park, it's also the site of a 2,000-year-old hill fort.
            On a clear day, the summit promises spectacular views of the cityscape.
            Escape from the hustle and bustle of the city at serene Dr. Neil's Garden by Duddingston Kirk.
            Overlooking Duddingston Loch on the lower slopes of Arthur's Seat, this quiet, verdant space is one of the most peaceful places in the city.
            Tucked away at the end of the Old Town, close to the Scottish Parliament Building, Dunbar's Garden is close to the Royal Mile, yet the crowds feel worlds away.
            The 17th-century garden has winding pathways, herbs, flowers, shrub gardens, and benches ideal for relaxing.
